# REUSE Example

This file is an example repository for REUSE compliance.  It is identical to
the example provided in [the tutorial](https://reuse.software/tutorial).

This repository contains two branches---one that is compliant with REUSE, and
one that has no copyright and licensing information whatsoever.  These are the
links to the branches:

- Compliant: <https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-example>

- Non-compliant: <https://github.com/fsfe/reuse-example/tree/noncompliant>

Feel free to poke around!
